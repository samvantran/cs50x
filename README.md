=====

These are my projects within CS50x. This is a full semester Harvard CS101 class.

So far, most of my programming has been in C and I've learned about:

- Compilers, libraries, header files
- Bytes, data types, and functions
- Arrays, variables, and simple encryption (Caesar and Vigenere ciphers)
- How to work the command line, debugging and the wonderful tool that is GDB
- BigO, Omega, and Theta; n2, n, nlogn, logn, and constant time
- Search and sorting methods; bubble, insertion, quicksort, selection 
- The elegance of recursion
- Pointers, stack vs heap, memory leaks, and Valgrind
- Just starting data structures with linked lists, hash tables, and tries.
  
Update: April 2013

Now I'm starting to learn about web programming. 

First project is in PHP, HTML, CSS, and a touch of SQL.

Future project will be in JavaScript.

To be continued...
